# Tour Management System
- In project, I have developed the Nemo Reef Tour Management System Console Application using Core Java.

- This application allows user to do following function: 

  1. For each of the N booking: enter Booking name, and then enter Number of passengers.
     - The program will output the charge for the booking.
     
  2. This program also validate the user input such as booking name is not blank, number of passengers must      be positive.


### How to run console application in command prompt

1. first compile the java code file using javac command
      - javac NemoReefTours.java
      
2. now you can run the application using java command
      - java NemoReefTours
